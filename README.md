# Secure Image Verification Blockchain Application

This project is an application that ensure images have not been tampered with by hosting the images in a decentralized file system called IPFS and keeping the images hashes secure in an Ethereum blockchain.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed nodejs
* You have installed the MetaMask Chrome extension and enabled it in your extensions
* You have installed Ganache as your personal blockchain from the Truffle framework
* You have installed the Truffle framework 


## Running the project 

* Fork or download the project from GitHub
* Navigate to the main folder 'Blockchain Hackathon' in your command line and run 'npm install'
* Open Ganache and either select 'Quickstart' or 'Set up a Workspace'
* From the main folder 'Blockchain Hackathon' in your command line, run 'truffle compile' to compile your smart contract
* From the main folder 'Blockchain Hackathon' in your command line, run 'truffle migrate' to deploy your smart contract
* From the main folder 'Blockchain Hackathon' in your command line, run 'npm run start'
* Once your code has run, navigate to the localhost site
* Select the MetaMask extension and ensure that the network is connected to the Ganache network
* In the MetaMask extension, use your 'Mnemonic' from Ganache as your 'seed phrase' to import your accounts from Ganache to MetaMask
